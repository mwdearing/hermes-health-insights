"""GLP-1 / incretin therapy monitoring (opt-in module ``glp1``).

Personal-baseline patterns from data you already collect, worded as information or "worth discussing with your
clinician". Nothing here diagnoses anything, says a medicine caused a change, or gives dosing or medication-change advice.
Thresholds are heuristics (each finding's ``source`` says so) and can be tuned in modules.yaml under
``glp1: {enabled: true, options: {...}}``. Research notes: the GLP-1 Monitoring project folder.

Rules (ids): glp1_rhr_rise, glp1_bp_lower, glp1_weight_rate, glp1_protein_low, glp1_energy_low,
glp1_dehydration_pattern, glp1_lean_share, glp1_strength_gap, glp1_glucose_low.
